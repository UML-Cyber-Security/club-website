This is a website for the UML cyber security club. This makes it easier to link to things during the meetings.

You can run hugo locally to debug the site with:

`hugo server --noHTTPCache`

HUGO lets you turn markdown files into an html webpage. You can make a new one with 

`hugo new content/posts/<post-title>.md`
